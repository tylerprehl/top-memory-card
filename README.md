# The Odin Project - Memory Card
This project's goal is to demonstrate and reinforce knowledge of React fundamentals, inlcuding use of React properties, state (useState), and side effects (useEffect). To run the game:
- clone the repo
- navigate your CLI to the repo folder
- install ```npm``` (if not already installed)
- run ```npm init``` (press ```enter``` a bunch of times)
- run ```npm run ???``` (I need to create a prod version and script to run it)
