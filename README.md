# The Odin Project - Memory Card
This project's goal is to demonstrate and reinforce knowledge of React fundamentals, inlcuding use of React properties, state (useState), and side effects (useEffect).

### To Run the Game:
- clone the repo
- navigate your CLI to the repo folder
- ??? (will include as soon as I know the answer)

### To Do: 
- resolve double render issue (development only occasionally causes a pokemon to render twice)
- implement card click handling
- implement score tracking
- classic Pokemon font could be really cool

### Main Takeaways
- TBD

### Other Interesting Things Learned
- using async functions (in this case, for an API call) in useEffect
